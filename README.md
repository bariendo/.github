## Purpose and Scope

This README establishes the mandatory development standards for all Bariendo engineering teams. These standards are designed to:

- Ensure compliance with healthcare regulations (HIPAA, HITECH, and applicable state laws)
- Maintain consistent code quality across all repositories
- Protect patient data and maintain system security
- Enable effective collaboration and knowledge transfer
- Support audit and regulatory review processes

**Scope:** These standards apply to all software development activities including:
- Application development (frontend, backend, mobile)
- Infrastructure as code
- Database schema changes
- Third-party integrations
- Internal tools and scripts

---

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Standards

All code contributions must meet the following requirements:

1. **Code Style**
   - Follow language-specific style guides (defined per repository)
   - Use linters and formatters configured in each project
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions
   - Document complex logic with clear comments

2. **Version Control**
   - All work must be performed in feature branches
   - Branch naming convention: `<type>/<ticket-id>-<brief-description>`
     - Types: `feature`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`, `refactor`
     - Example: `feature/BARI-123-patient-portal-login`
   - Commit messages must be clear and reference ticket numbers
   - Never commit secrets, credentials, or PHI to repositories

3. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies up to date with security patches
   - Document all third-party library usage
   - Obtain security approval for new dependencies
   - Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

### Prohibited Practices

The following practices are strictly prohibited:

- Committing directly to `main` or `production` branches
- Bypassing code review processes
- Storing credentials or API keys in code
- Using unapproved third-party services
- Testing with real patient data in non-production environments
- Disabling security tools or checks without approval

---

## Code Review Process

All code changes require review and approval before merging to protected branches.

### Review Requirements

| Environment | Minimum Reviewers | Required Approvals |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Development | 1 peer developer | 1 approval |
| Staging | 1 senior developer | 1 approval + automated checks |
| Production | 2 developers (1 senior) | 2 approvals + security scan |

### Review Checklist

Reviewers must verify:

- [ ] Code follows established style guides and patterns
- [ ] Unit tests are present and provide adequate coverage
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate and logged
- [ ] Changes are backward compatible (or documented)
- [ ] Security implications have been considered
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] HIPAA compliance requirements are met for PHI handling

### Review Timeline

- **Standard PRs:** Review within 24 business hours
- **Urgent/Hotfix PRs:** Review within 4 hours
- **Security PRs:** Expedited review with security team involvement

## Testing Requirements

### Required Test Coverage

| Component Type | Minimum Coverage | Required Tests |
|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| Backend API | 80% | Unit, Integration, Security |
| Frontend | 70% | Unit, Integration, E2E |
| Database Migrations | 100% | Rollback validation |
| Critical Paths | 100% | Unit, Integration, E2E |

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual functions and components
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Run in CI/CD pipeline on every commit

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test component interactions
   - Use test databases and services
   - Verify API contracts

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test critical user workflows
   - Run before production deployments
   - Include accessibility testing

4. **Security Tests**
   - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
   - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Penetration testing (quarterly)

### Test Data Requirements

- **NEVER** use real patient data for testing
- Use synthetic data generators for realistic test scenarios
- Anonymize and de-identify any production data used for debugging
- Document test data creation processes

---

## Deployment Procedures

### Deployment Environments

1. **Development** - Continuous deployment from `develop` branch
2. **Staging** - Manual promotion after QA approval
3. **Production** - Scheduled releases with change management approval

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before any production deployment:

- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] Security scans show no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Change management ticket approved
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Database migrations tested in staging
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts configured
- [ ] On-call engineer identified
- [ ] Deployment communication sent to stakeholders

### Deployment Windows

- **Standard Releases:** Tuesday/Thursday, 10 AM - 2 PM EST
- **Emergency Hotfixes:** Approved by Engineering Director
- **Blackout Periods:** No deployments during month-end/quarter-end

### Rollback Procedures

- Rollback decision must be made within 30 minutes of deployment issues
- Automated rollback available for all production deployments
- Post-rollback incident review required

## Security and Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance

All development activities must comply with HIPAA regulations:

1. **Access Controls**
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Implement least privilege principle

   - Log all access to PHI

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt PHI at rest (AES-256)
   - Encrypt PHI in transit (TLS 1.3+)
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Support patient rights (access, deletion, correction)

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all access and modifications to PHI
   - Maintain audit logs for 7 years
   - Protect logs from tampering
   - Enable security monitoring and alerting

### Security Requirements

- Complete security training annually
- Report security incidents within 1 hour of discovery
- Use approved encryption libraries
- Implement input validation and output encoding
- Follow OWASP Top 10 mitigation strategies
- Conduct security reviews for architecture changes

### Secrets Management
